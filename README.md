# Google-Maps-Places-Scraper

I've seen a lot of job posts on UpWork / Fiverr which require scraping places from Google Maps given a PIN / ZIP Code or an address. For example "Pizza Places in New York" or "Construction Companies for Postal Code {Any London Postal Code}". 

To make things easier, here's an app which you can use to easily scrape places from Google Maps.

Steps to setting-up this app:

1. Get Google Places API Key: https://ultimateelementor.com/docs/get-google-places-api-key/
2. Paste the API Key in ```API_KEY.txt```
3. Install requirements.txt : ```pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt```
4. To run the app, use the following command in the terminal: ```streamlit run main.py```


Here's a short demo of how the app works:
